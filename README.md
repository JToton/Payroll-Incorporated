# Payroll-Incorporated

## Description

• This website was designed with employee data in mind. Our task was to complete an existing codebase by adding functionality to input employee information and display it dynamically on the website. Here I had to learn how to not only write functions to complete this task but also how to incorperate it within existing code base. This required me to use existing variable names and function names in order to ensure that the previously given functions would still function correctly. We were tasked not to adjust the previous code base when the task was completed. During testing I did however adjust and change much of the existing code. Once I had figured out how to get everything working I then went back and patched everything back up to normal and debugged as I went. Finally I was able to get everything working almost as entended. This project caused me to debug quite a lot. Luckily for me, I rather enjoy debugging code. However, I underestimated just how much I would have to do. Along the way I learned a lot and refreshed my javascript experience. I have not used javascript in these manors since college. In fact, most of the scripting I do at work is quite easy and does not require as much complexity. Here I had to learn string manipulation, array usage and iteration, object interaction and creation as well as how arrays and objects work together. I even needed to utilize functions such as .sort and .toUppercase as well as many other existing functions wihin the language to achieve my goals. This was a very informative and fun project to undertake and I enjoyed much of it as I completed it.
